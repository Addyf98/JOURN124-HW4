# Why I found this topic interesting...
I selected the question "Is it rude to wake a passenger up if you are trying to go to the bathroom?" because it reveals fascinating social norms about personal space and courtesy in confined environments like airplanes. The dataset from FiveThirtyEight’s Flying Etiquette Survey is particularly interesting because it quantifies unspoken travel etiquette—showing how context (e.g., bathroom breaks vs. stretching legs) influences perceptions of rudeness.
# What does the chart shows...
My pie chart visualizes responses from 850 U.S. fliers:

63% said waking someone for bathroom breaks is not rude at all (n=535).
33% considered it somewhat rude (n=281).
Only 4% deemed it very rude (n=34).

This reveals a clear majority tolerance for necessary disruptions, contrasting with stricter views on other behaviors (e.g., seat reclining, per FiveThirtyEight’s article).
